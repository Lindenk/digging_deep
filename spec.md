# Digging Deep Specification #

This specification is for planned features that should be completed, and least partially, before release.

# Mechanics #

Caverns can be found using the handheld surveyor. An auto-surveyor or surveyor satellite can also be used to file caverns. Details in item descriptions.

A drill harness can be built over any caverns to break open the ground above them. This allows drill harnesses, elevators, hoists, and landfills to be built on top of them.

An elevator can then be placed on a newly created hole to allow players to move between the above ground and cavern.

Inside a cavern, items can be placed as normal, including drills to extract resources. To bring resources to the surface, hoists can be built over holes created by drills. Power can also be connected to the surface using power conduits.

To craft higher level items in the mod, a magma forge will need to be built over volcanic tiles in certain caverns.

#### Strominium Ore ####

World generated in underground caverns. A very strong metal. Used to make stronger versions of things that use steel.


### Components ###

#### Diamonite Plate ####

Refined diamonite ore. Used to craft higher level drills among other things in this mod. May be replaced by an ore in another mod to improve mod integration.

#### Strominium Plate ####

Refined strominium ore. Used to craft higher level drills among other things in this mod. May be replaced by an ore in another mod to improve mod integration.


### Placable ###

#### Drill Harness ####

Holds drill heads and drills into cavern spots to open them. Runs on fuel.

#### Electric Drill Harness ####

Holds drill heads and drills into cavern spots to open them. Runs on electricity.

#### Electric Hoist ####

Ferries material from below ground to above ground. Runs on electricity.

#### Personnel Elevator ####

Allows players to move between above and below ground. Runs on electricity.

#### Underground Power Conduit ####

Transmits power and wire signals from above ground to underground.

#### Geothermal Generator ####

Provides power when built on top of a geothermal vent.


### Consumable ###

#### Steel Drill Head ####

Used to open tech 1 caverns slowly. Is consumed over time when in use.

#### Diamonite Drill Head ####

Used to open a tech 1 or 2 cavern. Is consumed over time when in use.


### Usable ###

Handheld item that, when used, informs the player if they are standing on or near a cavern.


### Powersuit Modules ###

#### Auto-surveyor ####

Informs the player whenever they are standing over a cavern.


### Satellites ###

#### Surveyor Satellite ####

Reveals caverns on the map in a very large area around launch site.


## Locations ##

### Underground ###

#### Magma Forge ####

Used to make higher level items. Found in tech 1 underground areas.

#### Underground Ore Field ####

Large deposits of generated ore (iron, copper, coal, or stone in vanilla)

#### Underground Diamonite Deposit ####

Deposit of diamonite ore. Deposits are larger in higher tech caverns.

#### Geothermal Vent ####

Found in larger quantities in higher tech caverns. Provides power with a geothermal generator is built on top.
